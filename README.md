# tableturn

Simple shuffle of words

I named it tableturn as a reference to a joke made by **Micheal Scott** from the **The Office Season 5, Episode 23**.

The joke is that he's mixing up the expression 'How the tables have turned' to 'How the turntables'.

Usage:
```zsh
~ gcc -o tableturn tableturn.c
~ ./tableturn "your sentence"
```
